## Introduction 

The HockeyAppUnity-iOS plugin implements support for using HockeyApp in your Unity-iOS builds. It easily lets you keep track of crashes that have been caused by your scripts or Objective-C code.

## <a name="1"></a>Requirements (Version 1.0.6)
* [Changelog](Documentation/Changelog.md)

* Unity 5.0 or newer (SDK versions with Unity 4 support can be found at the [Unity Asset Store](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/?gclid=CO) or by switching to the appropriate release branch on GitHub).
* iOS 6.0 or newer.

## <a name="2"></a>Installation & Setup

The following steps illustrate how to integrate the HockeyAppUnity-iOS plugin:

### 1) Import plugin
Copy the **HockeyAppUnityIOS** folder as well as the **Editor** folder into the **Assets** directory of your Unity project. Both folders are subdirectories of the **Plugin** folder.

![alt text](Documentation/01_add_plugin.png  "Add plugin folders")

### <a name="create_game_object"></a>2) Create plugin-GameObject
Create an empty game object (*GameObject -> Create Empty*) and rename it (*HockeyAppUnityIOS*).

![alt text](Documentation/02_add_script.png "Rename gameobject")

Add the **HockeyAppIOS.cs** as a component of your new created gameobject.

![alt text](Documentation/03_add_component.png "Add script as component")

Select the game object in the **Hierarchy** pane and fill in some additional informations inside the Inspector window. 

* **App ID** - the app ID provided by HockeyApp
* **Secret** - the secret provided by HockeyApp (only for authentication using email address)
* **Authenticator Type** - an authentication type (see [Authenticating Users on iOS](http://support.hockeyapp.net/kb/client-integration-ios-mac-os-x/authenticating-users-on-ios)). By default **BITAuthenticatorIdentificationTypeAnonymous** will be used.
* **Server URL** - if you have your own server instance, please type in its url. <span style="color: red">In most cases this field should be left blank.</span>
* **Exception Logging** - by checking this option you will get more precise information about exceptions in your Unity scripts
* **Auto Upload** -  this option defines if the crash reporting feature should send crash reportings automatically without asking the user. 
* **Update Manager** - ckeck this option if users should be informed about app updates from inside your app

![alt text](Documentation/04_script_vars.png "Configure script")

### <a name="script_modification"></a>3) Modify post process script

Open PostProcessBuildPlayer (*Editor/PostProcessBuildPlayer*) and modify line 156:

![alt text](Documentation/05_postprocessbuildplayer.png "Configure script")

### 4) Add dependencies

![alt text](Documentation/09_add_dependencies.png "Add Dependencies")

To make the HockeyApp SDK work properly, we have to add some dependencies. Select the file **libHockeyAppUnity.a** from the **HockeyAppUnityIOS** folder and check the following frameworks:

* AssetsLibrary
* CoreText
* MobileCoreServices
* QuickLook
* Security

### 5) Configure build settings

You are now ready to build the Xcode project: Select *File -> Build Settings...* and switch to **iOS** in the platform section. Check **Development Build** and **Script Debugging** (see [Build Settings](#build_settings) section).

![alt text](Documentation/06_build_settings.png "Configure build settings")

Open the player settings and make sure that **Bundle identifier** (*Other settings -> Identification*) equals the bundle identifier of the app on HockeyApp (*Manage App -> Basic Data*).

![alt text](Documentation/07_player_settings.png "Configure player settings")

If you want to enable exception logging, please also select *Other settings -> Optimization -> Slow and safe* as well. Otherwise all exceptions will result in an app crash.

Press the **Build** button. You can now build and run your app.

## <a name="build_settings"></a>Build Settings

The **Development Build** and **Script Debugging** options affect the exception handling in C#. You will get a crash report in any case, but the data quality differs. It is recommend to enable those options for alpha and beta builds, but to disable them for production.

**Disabled Development Build, Disabled Script Debugging**:
	
Apple-style crash report for those exception types that cause a crash.

**Enabled Development Build, Disabled Script Debugging**

	IndexOutOfRangeException: Array index is out of range.
 		at (wrapper stelemref) object:stelemref (object,intptr,object)
 		at TestUI.OnGUI ()
 		
**Enabled Development Build, Enabled Script Debugging**:

	IndexOutOfRangeException: Array index is out of range.
 		at (wrapper stelemref) object:stelemref (object,intptr,object)
 		at TestUI.OnGUI () (at /Users/name/Documents/Workspace/HockeySDK-Unity-iOS/ExampleGame/Assets/TestUI/TestUI.cs:73)
 		
## <a name="3"></a>Examples

### Feedback Form

In order to provide your users with a feedback form, please define the following extern method in your C# script: 
	
	[DllImport("__Internal")]
	private static extern void HockeyApp_ShowFeedbackListView();
	
After that you can show the feedback form as follows:
	
	HockeyApp_ShowFeedbackListView(); 
	
## <a name="4"></a>Troubleshooting

If you have any problems with compiling the exported xCode projects, please check the following points:

### Libraries group

After exporting your Unity project, your xCode project should now contain the following files:

* **libHockeyAppUnity.a** & **HockeyAppUnityWrapper.m** (*Libraries/HockeyAppUnityIOS/*)
* **HockeySDKResources.bundle** (*Frameworks/HockeyAppUnityIOS/*)

If not, compiling your project will lead to different errors, e.g.

	Undefined symbols for architecture armv7:
  	  "_OBJC_CLASS_$_HockeyAppUnity", referenced from:
      	objc-class-ref in HockeyAppUnityWrapper.o
      	objc-class-ref in UnityAppController.o
      	objc-class-ref in UnityAppController+ViewHandling.o
	ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture armv7
	clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
	
or

	ld: warning: directory not found for option '-L"/Path/to/project/Libraries"'
	Undefined symbols for architecture armv7:
  	  "_HockeyApp_StartHockeyManager", referenced from:
	      RegisterMonoModules() in RegisterMonoModules.o
	  "_HockeyApp_ShowFeedbackListView", referenced from:
	      RegisterMonoModules() in RegisterMonoModules.o
	  "_HockeyApp_GetBundleIdentifier", referenced from:
	      RegisterMonoModules() in RegisterMonoModules.o
	  "_HockeyApp_GetAppVersion", referenced from:
	      RegisterMonoModules() in RegisterMonoModules.o
	ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture armv7
	clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)	

Please note that Unity only copies those files if you import them correctly. Go back to your Unity project â€“ the files should be located at *Assets/Plugins/iOS*.

### Errors in HockeyAppUnityWrapper.m

If your Xcode gives you several errors for HockeyAppUnityWrapper.m, you'll have to set the `-fno-objc-arc` compiler flag under *Build Phases -> Compile Sources*

![alt text](Documentation/08_disable_arc.png "Disable ARC for HockeyAppUnityWrapper.m")

### PostprocessBuildPlayer

A lot of errors may occure if the **PostprocessBuildPlayer** file is not in the right directory of your Unity project. This file does some configuration to make the plugin work out of the box. It should be located at *Assets/Editor* of your Unity project.

#### Authentication type not working

Please open the **PostprocessBuildPlayer** file and make sure that it has been modified correctly (see [Modify post process script](#script_modification)).

The **info.plist** of your xCode project should contain the key **URL types** with your app ID as value of one of its children.

Furthermore, the following lines of code

	if([HockeyAppUnity handleOpenURL:url sourceApplication:sourceApplication annotation:annotation]){
        return YES;
    }

should be part of the method

	- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication*)application openURL:(NSURL*)url sourceApplication:(NSString*)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation

inside the class *Classes/UnityAppController.mm*.

#### Crash reporting / Feedback form / Update Manager not working

If the project compiles just fine but none of the features seem to work, please check the class *Classes/UI/UnityAppController+ViewHandling.mm*.

The last line of the method

	- (void)showGameUI
	
should be

	[HockeyAppUnity sendViewLoadedMessageToUnity];

This might also happen if you forgot to put the app ID inside the script form of the Unity project (see [Create plugin-GameObject](#create_game_object)).
